# MobileDevicesProject
A Repository for CSCI 4100U; Mobile Devices final project.

*Objective of Project:* The purpo#se of this project was to develop a solution which combines the tools and concepts used in the CSCI 4100U class which include: android layouts, resources, intents, broadcast receivers, internet resources and database storage/access and the use of geocoding and Google Maps.

*Project:* The goals of this project was to develop an application that empowered everyday travellors to reach one destination to another in the most optimal way possible. The application leverages the Google Maps API to create an environmet where the user specifies where they want to go - from beginning of the journey to end, the budget they have to travel there and and the vehicle they are using to travel with. The application uses the current gas pricing, vehicle fuel consumption and provides the best 4 options (if all available) to reach a particular destination. The Algorithm developed involves looking at all the current options and formulating the top 4 for the user to reach their destination without going over budget. 

The application also enables the user to look at the 5-day forecast from the webview of a website which enbales them to make arrangements ahead of time as well as viewing gas pricing specifically by being referred to GasBuddy website directly to be more speicific of the gas prices in the area they are looking into. 

In order to use the application, the user musts sign-up with their own credentials and create their own username and password to have access to the application at all times.
